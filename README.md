[My Spy (PC)](https://github.com/Miro382/My-Spy)

My Spy is a surveillance/monitoring app which works on both a personal computer and a phone. Our computer application can monitor and block internet sites or social networks, and can also block and find out what applications the user has been using, find out what the user has written and set the maximum usage time on the computer. The mobile app monitors SMS messages, phone calls, user’s movements, and the apps he has used. Another part of the app is a communications app which works on both the computer and the mobile phone, and is used for communication, for example, between a child and his parent. Whether computer or mobile, the app can be protected from being uninstalled and having damaged data. Monitoring reports are processed to provide details and for better transparency each report contains charts and statistics.The application is fully customizable in whatever way the user desires. If the user does not want to use a „keylogger“ or monitor the internet, he can turn these functions off. On the other hand if he wants to, with one click in the app he can activate them.


Our goal was to make a monitoring app that can increase Internet and computer security. The app is divided into a mobile app for Android and computer app. The computer app can monitor the internet, block websites and social networks, block and find out what applications the user has been using, find out what the user has written, and set the maximum usage time of the computer. The mobile app monitors SMS messages, phone calls, user’s movements, and the apps he has used. Another part is the "My Spy Chat" program, which is used for communication, for example, between a parent and a child. This app also works under Windows or Android’s operating system. The user simply registers and he is able to log in from his computer, notebook or Android. Whether computer or mobile, the app can be protected from being uninstalled and having damaged data.

Our priority was also encryption and application security. We encrypt the passwords and communications with a very strong method. Monitoring reports are processed to provide details and for better transparency each report contains charts and statistics. The content of the application is also the time spent in front of the computer to help evaluate the status. The statistics count the total time spent in front of the computer per day, the average per month, and the total average over the period of use. The application is fully customizable in whatever way the user desires. If the user does not want to use a „keylogger“ or monitor the internet, he can turn these functions off. On the other hand if he wants to, with one click in the app he can activate them. The application also displays current weather or notes. A note may also be password-protected to protect against erasure. In a note we can also set a time stamp that reminds us of the time or attaches it to the “My Spy” home page. We have achieved our initial goals which we have set, and we have even added some improvements.
